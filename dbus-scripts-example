# Example of dbus-scripts control file
#
# Each line of these files represents a filter to call a script.
# Tokens are separated by white space.
# First token on line is the script to execute.
# Subsequent tokens are filters to match arguments from dbus message.
# Filters are matched like shell wildcards (using fnmatch(3)).
# If a filter is specified (even if it is *), the corresponding argument
# must be present in order to get a match.
#
# First argument is sender
# Second argument is destination
# For SIGNAL and METHOD_CALL, third argument is interface
# For SIGNAL and METHOD_CALL, fourth argument is member
# Other arguments depend on the message
#
# Example: to act on WLAN interface state changes use:
#/some/script * * com.nokia.icd status_changed * WLAN_INFRA
# In /some/script, $5 will be the interface name and $7 the new state (IDLE, CONNECTED, etc.)
